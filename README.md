# Student-Management-System
This project is a **Student Management System** developed as part of a mini-project at **Abdelmalek Essaadi University**. It is built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows for efficient management of student information through two distinct user roles: **students** and **administrators**.
# Features:
+ **Login and Registration:** Students can create an account, log in securely, and manage their personal information.
+ **Student Dashboard:** Students can view available courses, check their timetable, and update their details.
+ **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators can manage student records, including adding, modifying, and deleting students.
+ **Database Integration:** Student data is securely stored using XAMPP as the backend database.
+ **Validation & Security:** Ensures proper validation of email addresses and mandatory fields, with password reset functionality for students.

# Technologies Used:
- **Python:** Main programming language.
- **Tkinter:** Used for creating the GUI.
- **XAMPP:** Manages the backend database.
- **PyCharm:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
