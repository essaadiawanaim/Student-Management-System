# Student-Management-System
This project is a Student Management System developed as part of a mini-project at Abdelmalek Essaadi University. It is built using Python and the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows for efficient management of student information through two distinct user roles: students and administrators.
